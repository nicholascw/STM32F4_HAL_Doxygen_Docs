\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  This driver implements a high level communication layer for read and write from/to 
  this memory. The needed STM32 hardware resources (SDMMC and GPIO) are performed by 
  the user in HAL_MMC_MspInit() function (MSP layer).                             
  Basically, the MSP layer configuration should be the same as we provide in the 
  examples.
  You can easily tailor this configuration according to hardware resources.

[..]
  This driver is a generic layered driver for SDMMC memories which uses the HAL 
  SDMMC driver functions to interface with MMC and eMMC cards devices. 
  It is used as follows:

  (#)Initialize the SDMMC low level resources by implement the HAL_MMC_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the SDMMC interface clock using __HAL_RCC_SDMMC_CLK_ENABLE(); 
      (##) SDMMC pins configuration for MMC card
          (+++) Enable the clock for the SDMMC GPIOs using the functions __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE();   
          (+++) Configure these SDMMC pins as alternate function pull-up using HAL_GPIO_Init()
                and according to your pin assignment;
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_MMC_ReadBlocks_DMA()
           and HAL_MMC_WriteBlocks_DMA() APIs).
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using __HAL_RCC_DMAx_CLK_ENABLE(); 
          (+++) Configure the DMA using the function HAL_DMA_Init() with predeclared and filled. 
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process when using DMA transfer.
          (+++) Configure the SDMMC and DMA interrupt priorities using functions
                HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(); DMA priority is superior to SDMMC's priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC DMA and SDMMC IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
          (+++) SDMMC interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_MMC_ENABLE_IT() 
                and __HAL_MMC_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
          (+++) SDMMC interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_MMC_GET_IT()
                and __HAL_MMC_CLEAR_IT()
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_MMC_ReadBlocks_IT()
           and HAL_MMC_WriteBlocks_IT() APIs).
          (+++) Configure the SDMMC interrupt priorities using function
                HAL_NVIC_SetPriority();
          (+++) Enable the NVIC SDMMC IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
          (+++) SDMMC interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_MMC_ENABLE_IT() 
                and __HAL_MMC_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
          (+++) SDMMC interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_MMC_GET_IT()
                and __HAL_MMC_CLEAR_IT()
  (#) At this stage, you can perform MMC read/write/erase operations after MMC card initialization  

       
*** MMC Card Initialization and configuration ***
================================================    
[..]
  To initialize the MMC Card, use the HAL_MMC_Init() function. It Initializes 
  SDMMC IP (STM32 side) and the MMC Card, and put it into StandBy State (Ready for data transfer). 
  This function provide the following operations:

  (#) Initialize the SDMMC peripheral interface with defaullt configuration.
      The initialization process is done at 400KHz. You can change or adapt 
      this frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field. 
      The MMC Card frequency (SDMMC_CK) is computed as follows:

         SDMMC_CK = SDMMCCLK / (ClockDiv + 2)

      In initialization mode and according to the MMC Card standard, 
      make sure that the SDMMC_CK frequency doesn't exceed 400KHz.

      This phase of initialization is done through SDMMC_Init() and 
      SDMMC_PowerState_ON() SDMMC low level APIs.

  (#) Initialize the MMC card. The API used is HAL_MMC_InitCard().
      This phase allows the card initialization and identification 
      and check the MMC Card type (Standard Capacity or High Capacity)
      The initialization flow is compatible with MMC standard.

      This API (HAL_MMC_InitCard()) could be used also to reinitialize the card in case 
      of plug-off plug-in.

  (#) Configure the MMC Card Data transfer frequency. By Default, the card transfer 
      frequency is set to 24MHz. You can change or adapt this frequency by adjusting 
      the "ClockDiv" field.
      In transfer mode and according to the MMC Card standard, make sure that the 
      SDMMC_CK frequency doesn't exceed 25MHz and 50MHz in High-speed mode switch.
      To be able to use a frequency higher than 24MHz, you should use the SDMMC 
      peripheral in bypass mode. Refer to the corresponding reference manual 
      for more details.

  (#) Select the corresponding MMC Card according to the address read with the step 2.
  
  (#) Configure the MMC Card in wide bus mode: 4-bits data.

*** MMC Card Read operation ***
==============================
[..] 
  (+) You can read from MMC card in polling mode by using function HAL_MMC_ReadBlocks(). 
      This function allows the read of 512 bytes blocks.
      You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation 
      by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
      After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
      through HAL_MMC_GetCardState() function for MMC card state.

*** MMC card status ***
====================== 
[..]
  (+) The MMC Status contains status bits that are related to the MMC Memory 
      Card proprietary features. To get MMC card status use the HAL_MMC_GetCardStatus().

*** MMC card information ***
=========================== 
[..]
  (+) To get MMC card information, you can use the function HAL_MMC_GetCardInfo().
      It returns useful information about the MMC card such as block size, card type,
      block number ...

*** MMC card CSD register ***

 [..]
  (@) You can refer to the MMC HAL driver header file for more useful macros 
    
*** Callback registration ***
=============================================
[..]
  The compilation define USE_HAL_MMC_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
  allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.

  Use Functions @ref HAL_MMC_RegisterCallback() to register a user callback,
  it allows to register following callbacks:
    (+) TxCpltCallback : callback when a transmission transfer is completed.
    (+) RxCpltCallback : callback when a reception transfer is completed.
    (+) ErrorCallback : callback when error occurs.
    (+) AbortCpltCallback : callback when abort is completed.
    (+) MspInitCallback    : MMC MspInit.
    (+) MspDeInitCallback  : MMC MspDeInit.
  This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
  and a pointer to the user callback function.

  Use function @ref HAL_MMC_UnRegisterCallback() to reset a callback to the default
  weak (surcharged) function. It allows to reset following callbacks:
    (+) TxCpltCallback : callback when a transmission transfer is completed.
    (+) RxCpltCallback : callback when a reception transfer is completed.
    (+) ErrorCallback : callback when error occurs.
    (+) AbortCpltCallback : callback when abort is completed.
    (+) MspInitCallback    : MMC MspInit.
    (+) MspDeInitCallback  : MMC MspDeInit.
  This function) takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle and the Callback ID.

  By default, after the @ref HAL_MMC_Init and if the state is HAL_MMC_STATE_RESET
  all callbacks are reset to the corresponding legacy weak (surcharged) functions.
  Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit callbacks that are respectively
  reset to the legacy weak (surcharged) functions in the @ref HAL_MMC_Init 
  and @ref  HAL_MMC_DeInit only when these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
  If not, MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the @ref HAL_MMC_Init and @ref HAL_MMC_DeInit
  keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand)

  Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in READY state only.
  Exception done for MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks that can be registered/unregistered
  in READY or RESET state, thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used
  during the Init/DeInit.
  In that case first register the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
  using @ref HAL__RegisterCallback before calling @ref HAL_MMC_DeInit 
  or @ref HAL_MMC_Init function.

  When The compilation define USE_HAL_MMC_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
  not defined, the callback registering feature is not available 
  and weak (surcharged) callbacks are used.
