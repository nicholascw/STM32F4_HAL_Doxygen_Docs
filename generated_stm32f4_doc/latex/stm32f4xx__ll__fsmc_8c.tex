F\+S\+MC Low Layer H\+AL module driver. 

\begin{DoxyAuthor}{作者}
M\+CD Application Team \begin{DoxyVerb}     This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
     functionalities of the Flexible Static Memory Controller (FSMC) peripheral memories:
      + Initialization/de-initialization functions
      + Peripheral Control functions 
      + Peripheral State functions
\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### FSMC peripheral features #####
==============================================================================                  
  [..] The Flexible static memory controller (FSMC) includes two memory controllers:
       (+) The NOR/PSRAM memory controller
       (+) The NAND/PC Card memory controller
     
  [..] The FSMC functional block makes the interface with synchronous and asynchronous static
       memories, SDRAM memories, and 16-bit PC memory cards. Its main purposes are:
       (+) to translate AHB transactions into the appropriate external device protocol.
       (+) to meet the access time requirements of the external memory devices.
 
  [..] All external memories share the addresses, data and control signals with the controller.
       Each external device is accessed by means of a unique Chip Select. The FSMC performs
       only one access at a time to an external device.
       The main features of the FSMC controller are the following:
        (+) Interface with static-memory mapped devices including:
           (++) Static random access memory (SRAM).
           (++) Read-only memory (ROM).
           (++) NOR Flash memory/OneNAND Flash memory.
           (++) PSRAM (4 memory banks).
           (++) 16-bit PC Card compatible devices.
           (++) Two banks of NAND Flash memory with ECC hardware to check up to 8 Kbytes of
                data.
        (+) Independent Chip Select control for each memory bank.
        (+) Independent configuration for each memory bank.          \end{DoxyVerb}
